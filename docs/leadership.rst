Führungsetage
=============

Unser Team in der Führungsetage besteht aus bezahlten und freiwilligen
Mitarbeitern, die die ganze Breite der Erfahrung und Expertise beim
Entwickeln von Produkten, die Menschen lieben, repräsentieren und die
die Gemeinschaften stärken, um einen deutlichen Einfluss auf das Projekt
und die Welt zu nehmen. Diese Teams haben zwar tagtäglich unterschiedliche
Verantwortlichkeiten und Kernaufgaben, aber sie werden alle durch unsere
gemeinnützige, quelloffene und gemeinschaftsbasierte Mission, Identität
und Werte geleitet.

Vorstandsvorsitzende

    I've been with Mozilla since the Time Before Time -- since before the web
    was everywhere.

    "Voice" of Mozilla, chairwoman of the board (both foundation and
    Mozilla corp). Currently I focus on how we bring our priniciples into
    the new worlds we're working in, and how we meld our ideals with the
    practical reality of the world as we find it.

Chief Executive Officer

    I am currently serving as CEO of Mozilla Corporation and a member of the
    Board of Directors.

    I've been a Mozillian for almost a decade, joining the early paid staff
    of the Mozilla Foundation in 2004 prior to the release of Firefox to
    lead marketing and product management as VP Products from Firefox 1.0
    to Firefox 3. Following that, I built and led Mozilla Labs as
    Chief Innovation Officer for two years before taking on my last role as a
    paid staff member (before stepping in as interim CEO this year), becoming
    the Chief Marketing Officer responsible for our global marketing and
    engagement programs through June 2013.

    From June 2013 to April 2014, while I was no longer a paid staff member,
    I continued to be involved as a volunteer in a strategic advisor role.

    Outside of Mozilla, I was most recently an Executive-in-Residence at
    Greylock Partners. I also serve on the
    National Board of Directors of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
